# TCC Battlecode Engine RS
An unofficial, community-driven port of the MIT Battlecode game engine to the Rust programming language. This project aims to create a high-performance, safe, and modern version of the engine for educational and competitive use.
This port is based on the Battlecode 2025 version.

## About Battlecode
Battlecode is a real-time strategy (RTS) game and programming competition from MIT. Participants write an AI player in Java or Python to command a virtual robot army. The game engine runs matches between players to determine the winner.
## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a complete, functional version of the Battlecode engine in Rust. We aim to:
- **Achieve High Performance:** Leverage Rust's performance characteristics to create a fast and efficient game.
- **Ensure Safety and Reliability:** Utilize Rust's memory and thread safety guarantees to build a robust and crash-resistant server.
- **Provide a Modern Toolchain:** Use Cargo and the Rust ecosystem for a modern, easy-to-use build process.
- **Enable Multi-Language Player APIs:** The ultimate goal is to expose a clean, stable API from the Rust core, allowing competitors to write bots in a variety of languages, including:
  - **Rust**
  - **C++**
  - **Python**
  - **Java**
This project is an excellent opportunity for those interested in Game Development, systems programming, and cross-language interoperability.
## Current Status
### ðŸš§ This project is in the early stages of development. ðŸš§
The initial focus is on porting the core data structures, game constants, and the main game loop in Rust. See the [Issues](https://github.com/michaelnutt2/tccd-battlecode-engine-rs/issues) for a detailed project plan and tasks that are ready to be worked on.
## Getting Started
To build the core engine, you will need the Rust toolchain installed.
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaelnutt2/tccd-battlecode-engine-rs.git
cd tccd-battlecode-engine-rs

# 2. Build the project
cargo build --release

# 3. Run the engine (example)
# Actual command-line arguments are TBD
./target/release/tccd-battlecode-engine-rs --map "maps/default.map25" "player1" "player2"
```
